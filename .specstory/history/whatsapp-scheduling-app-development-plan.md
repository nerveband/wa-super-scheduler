_**User**_

Follow your memory bank. Then do the following:

**Below is a streamlined summary of your voice note and requirements, followed by a clean, step-by-step prompt you could provide to an LLM or a developer.**

---

## 1. Cleaned-Up Requirements

1. **Goal**  
   - Build a WhatsApp scheduling application that allows scheduling text (MVP) and eventually media (images, videos, audio, polls) to specific WhatsApp groups or individual contacts.

2. **Architecture Overview**  
   - **Server Component** (persistent WhatsApp connection):
     - Maintains the WhatsApp session (using either Python or Node.js, whichever library is more robust/stable for your environment).
     - Receives scheduled messages from the client and sends them at the correct time.
     - Stores and manages data (scheduling info, group lists, etc.).
   - **Client Component** (web application or browser-based UI):
     - Lets you create, schedule, delete, preview, and manage messages in a calendar view.
     - Allows for selecting which groups/contacts to send the message to.
     - Sends scheduling instructions and message data to the server via APIs.

3. **Core MVP Features**  
   - **Text-Only Scheduling**  
     - Create text messages with scheduled send times.  
     - View these scheduled messages on a visual calendar (drag-and-drop or standard date/time picker).
   - **Send to Groups/Individuals**  
     - Pick multiple WhatsApp groups or specific contacts for each scheduled message.
   - **Delete Messages**  
     - Ability to trigger the “delete for everyone” if still within WhatsApp’s allowed timeframe.
   - **Preview & Test**  
     - Option to send a test message to yourself before sending to the group.
   - **Calendar/List View**  
     - See upcoming scheduled posts in multiple views: daily/weekly/monthly or a simple list.
   - **Persistent Server**  
     - The WhatsApp session must remain active so scheduling works 24/7.

4. **Expanded Future Features** (beyond MVP)  
   - Support for images, videos, audio, polls.  
   - Message templates / library of past content.  
   - Categories/tags for different post types.  
   - Automated scheduling suggestions for event promotions.  
   - Advanced analytics and campaign management.

5. **Technology Recommendations**  
   - **Server**  
     - Python + [pywhatkit] or [selenium-web-whatsapp], OR  
     - Node.js + [Baileys] for multi-device WhatsApp API.  
     - A scheduler like `APScheduler` (Python) or `node-cron` (Node) to handle timed sends.  
   - **Client**  
     - A lightweight web app using React (or basic HTML/CSS/JS if you want simplicity).  
     - A UI toolkit (Tailwind CSS, or shadcn/ui) plus [FullCalendar.js] for the scheduling calendar.  
   - **Data Storage**  
     - An SQL or NoSQL DB. For quick prototyping, SQLite can suffice.  
     - Store scheduled messages, group/contacts data, and message history.

6. **Local Development & Deployment**  
   - **Local Dev**: Mac or Windows environment with Node.js or Python installed.  
   - **Deployment**: Likely a Linux VPS or container (e.g., Docker) for the server piece to keep the WhatsApp session active. The client can be served from the same machine or a separate hosting service.

## 2. Step-by-Step Prompt for an LLM or Developer

Below is a concise prompt you could provide to an AI or hand to a developer to structure the app’s MVP and plan iterative phases.

> **WhatsApp Scheduler MVP Prompt**  
>  
> 1. **Project Description**:  
>    - I need a WhatsApp scheduling application that sends text messages to multiple groups or individual contacts at specific times. In future versions, it will also handle media (images, videos, audio, polls).  
>  
> 2. **Architecture Requirements**:  
>    - Must include a “Server Component” that retains an active WhatsApp session and handles message sending/deleting.  
>    - Must include a “Client Component” (web UI) that allows scheduling, editing, and previewing messages on a calendar.  
>    - Data is persisted in a database (SQLite for MVP is acceptable).  
>  
> 3. **MVP Feature Requirements**:  
>    - Text-only scheduling.  
>    - Send to multiple groups/contacts.  
>    - Visual calendar UI for scheduling.

>        - Node.js + Baileys.  
>      - **Client**:  
>        - React + Tailwind CSS + FullCalendar.js.  
>        - Alternatively, minimal HTML/JS + existing drag/drop calendar library.  
>      - **Scheduling**: APScheduler (Python) or node-cron (Node).  
>      - **Database**: SQLite for prototyping.  
>  
> 5. **Implementation Plan**:  
>    **Stage 1: Server Setup**  
>      - Pick WhatsApp library (Python or Node).  
>      - Implement basic WhatsApp authentication & session.  
>      - Create minimal APIs (POST /api/messages, GET /api/messages, DELETE /api/messages/:id).  
>      - Integrate a basic scheduling job for sending messages at the correct time.  
>    
>    **Stage 2: Client Setup**  
>      - Build a simple web interface (React or plain HTML/CSS/JS).  
>      - Integrate a calendar library (FullCalendar.js).  
>      - Implement form for scheduling new textual messages (time, recipients, content).  
>      - Call server APIs to create/list/delete scheduled messages.  
>      - Add a “send test to self” button.  
>    
>    **Stage 3: Polishing**  
>      - Improve error handling & notifications.  
>      - Refine calendar UI (drag-and-drop or better date/time pickers).  
>      - Basic responsive design for mobile use.  
>    
>    **Stage 4: Next Phases**  
>      - Media support (images, video, audio).  
>      - Template/library of past messages.  
>      - Categories & tags for more advanced organization.  
>      - Automated scheduling suggestions for event-based marketing.  
>      - Analytics & reporting (message success logs, read confirmations, etc.).  
>  
> 6. **Environment & Testing**:  
>    - **Local**:  
>      - Develop on Mac/Windows with Node.js or Python.  
>      - Use a local SQLite DB for quick iteration.  
>      - For the WhatsApp session, keep the console open to scan a QR code or store credentials for persistent login.  
>    - **Server Deployment**:  
>      - Host on a Linux VPS or container.  
>      - Keep the process running using PM2 (Node) or a systemd service (Python).  
>      - Expose client from the same server or a separate hosting service.  
>  
> 7. **Success Criteria**:  
>    - Ability to schedule text messages (single or multiple recipients) via a user-friendly calendar UI.  
>    - Reliable, persistent WhatsApp session that sends out messages on time.  
>    - Delete functionality within WhatsApp’s “delete for everyone” timeframe.  
>    - Clear logs and error-handling to track message sends.  
>  
> 8. **Questions & Clarifications**:  
>    - Which WhatsApp library or approach (Python vs. Node) best suits our hosting environment?  
>    - How robust does the scheduling need to be (e.g., recurring tasks, advanced triggers)?  
>    - How will user authentication and roles be handled (single admin user vs. multi-tenant)?  
>    - Confirm that once the MVP is stable, we aim to expand into media messages, categories, analytics, etc.

### How to Use this Prompt
You can copy/paste this prompt into your conversation with an LLM or hand it off to a developer. It concisely captures the MVP scope and planned architecture. From there, you can iterate on details like choice of WhatsApp library, hosting provider, and user authentication specifics.

---

## 3. Notes on Best Libraries
- **Python**  
  - [pywhatkit]: Quick scripts, good for simple text-based tasks, but less robust on multi-device scenarios.  
  - Selenium-based solutions: May be heavier to maintain (headless browser), but can work if multi-device libraries are not reliable.  
- **Node.js**  
  - [Baileys]: Actively maintained, specifically built for multi-device WhatsApp. Has robust community support and well-documented capabilities.

Given your Mac development environment and eventual Linux server deployment, you can use either ecosystem comfortably. Choose whichever stack aligns with your team’s skills and preferences.

---

**That’s the concise layout**—it should be clear, testable locally, and easily deployed once stable. Feel free to refine each stage as you progress!
