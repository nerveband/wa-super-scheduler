## WhatsApp Message Scheduler Development Plan (1/17/2025, 3:12:12 PM)

_**User**_


All right, so um I have this idea for an app and so I I need some help to process the thought, but basically um I have a WhatsApp account and on this WhatsApp account, I am an admin of several groups. So on those groups are typically lots of people who like to get certain types of messages, whether it is text messages or whether it is um uh pictures with text or videos or audio, um or or pull. And so what I want to be able to do is I want to be able to schedule visually uh these posts in advance on this WhatsApp account. Now, because WhatsApp is restricted, uh in the sense that it doesn't have a direct EBI, we have to use a Python library uh in order to access it. So, like, there's Bailey Python library, which can work for us, um, or other a Piwet kit and whatnot. There's so many different options. We have to take a look at them. So now, I wanna think about it in a way that I have a server component that is always running and is always monitoring the WhatsApp and is performing the actions that a client sends to it. So the server will perform the actions. that could be like a Python script or a no JS server or whatever makes the most sense. and then we have the client that's gonna communicate to this. um and ideally, I would like the client to be able to communicate to it using PhHP. and like a PhP application, because I feel like that's the easiest a program and most flexible to adaptive changes that can be changed on the spot on a server versus, like, something like no JS or Python. um although, you know, tell me otherwise. And I I want to think about these things. The client should do the following. The the user, like me as a user, I should be able to do the following. I should be able to see a calendar view, whether it is a deview, a week view, a month view, a year view of posts that are scheduled or a list of view of posts that are scheduled, I should be able to schedule a new post, whether it's text, an image, text with image, a video, audio or poll I should be able to I should be able to delete any post that has gone out so with the WhatsApp has a certain time frame that if you post something, you could delete it for everyone. So just in case I send out something accidentally. and then I should be able to choose which groups automatically get the message and maybe for a certain post, I don't want it to go to a certain group so I can disable it. And I can send messages to groups or individuals. I should also have like a library, like a bank of um resources that I can pull from so like when I'm adding an image or a picture, uh I can say like, oh, this was the last post, or this was the last five texts that I can click on it and then just load it up and bring it in. Like, that should be an option, right? So, um yeah, and what else? um And then maybe add some organizing to my posts so like I can have like categories of posts that I can filter through, so like one could be like youth groups, or I should be able to make these groups, but, like, it could be youth posts, or it could be weekly announcements, or it could be special one-out events, and even gets to the point where you could even suggest a pattern for promotion. So, for instance, like, I should be able to like drop in like my event details on my date, and it'll say like, oh, since your event is like three weeks ahead of time, you should market it uh two times or three times, and these are the dates we recommend, would you like a to schedule draft posts? uh and then you can uh publish them if you want to? Okay, now, since and then as the client submits all these things to the server, the server needs to do those actions and should keep track of those actions. The data should probably be stored on the server Or does it make sense to store on the client? I don't know which one's more resilient, but we don't want to send all the data. We don't wanna keep pulling all the data to the client all the time, but we also don't wanna save all the data to this server. I don't know. like you want to upload something as a server? Maybe that makes sense. Like the client ends uploading everything to the server all the time. It should be easy to pair the WhatsApp. so I the way it should work is that the client should automatically check if the server is on to the server is not on, it tries to turn on the server remotely if it can. um or the user has to turn on the server, whatever makes the most sense. I don't know what would be appropriate. But basically to make it easy so that because WhatsApp is dependent on a persistent client at all times. like it dependent on like a persistent server at all times checking the messages and having been logged in the phone using the any of the libraries that exist out there. Make it easy to search through posts that have been posted, and when they've been posted and filter through that. Now, I recognize that because this is a very feature filled app, I want to simplify the app. So let's do the bare minimum, okay? So what would be the easiest thing as a MVP for us to launch is just text and images with text. Or even simpler than that just text to be honest, just text post. Let's make it simple. Just text posts and I want to take those text posts and be able to schedule them on a visual calendar with selected groups that I can choose or individual messages. and I should be able to delete messages that were sent out And it has to be a client and server component. Maybe the client can be on the server and serve from the same space, so it doesn't inherently have to be separate. Although ideally, I would love it if, like, you have a client on your computer, for instance. And then the server you connect to a server, because then you don't have to keep your computer all the time. That's the benefit of the client server relationship thing. But maybe no, I don't know. I I don't know the best approach for this. I don't know the best approach for this. So I am looking for your guidance and support to make that happen to help give me clarity on what to do. yeah. kind of think what else. um It should use simple reusable libraries. So it shouldn't reinvent the wheel. If there is already a component that does scheduling and it does like if there's a library that already exists just those libraries, um is better to use a library that's battle tested than to build it from scratch. Like so if there's already a dragonrop calendar system and we can integrate into it, let's do that, and then we just extend it. Same thing with like this client server components, like only build what's necessary and build it on stable URs stable infrastructure. So, if it's Shat and UI, Shat and CNUI or if it's a tailwind, um whatever is clean, reusable, simple Javacript, and simple HTML and simple CSS that is visually easy to look at and nice to look at. uh, that's a that's a it may come up with a couple of names. So that's the current uh thought process that I have based on this voice note what I'm thinking of. And ultimately what I want to do is take what I've been talking about the voice voice note, first, clean it up completely, like clean up everything that I'm talking about so that there's like a logical hierarchy and flow. and then rewrite it as a prompt that I can give to an LLM so that it can create a detailed plan for a developer to implement this idea starting from the MVP stage and breaking even the MVP stage to do a stage where stage by stage, and then talking about the next phase and whatnot and make that easy. Oh, add a feature so that it could send a test example of the post to yourself, like to the user itself? So like, if it's my WhatsApp, I can I can send it to myself. So then that way I can check something beforehand and even add an ability to like preview it, maybe like have a WhatsApp design so like, this is what your message is going to look like when you uh hit draft or publish? That might be a cool option. Thanks.

# WhatsApp Message Scheduler - Technical Specification

## System Overview
A system to schedule and manage WhatsApp messages across multiple groups and individuals, consisting of a server component for WhatsApp interaction and a client interface for message management.

## Core Requirements

### MVP Features (Phase 1)
1. Text-only message scheduling
   - Schedule messages to specific groups/individuals
   - Visual calendar interface
   - Message deletion capability
   - Test message preview to self

### Architecture

#### Server Component
- **Technology**: Python
  - Rationale: Strong WhatsApp library support (pywhatkit, selenium-whatsapp)
  - Handles WhatsApp session management
  - Processes scheduled messages
  - Manages message queue and delivery

#### Client Component
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
    - Uses shadcn/ui for pre-built components
    - FullCalendar.js for calendar view

2. Message preview styling
3. Basic responsive design
4. Error notifications

### Future Phases

#### Phase 2
- Media message support (images, videos)
- Message templates/library
- Advanced scheduling patterns
- Message categories

#### Phase 3
- Campaign management
- Analytics
- Bulk scheduling
- Advanced preview features

## Technical Considerations

### Libraries and Dependencies

#### Server
- pywhatkit or selenium-whatsapp for WhatsApp interaction
- Flask/FastAPI for API endpoints
- APScheduler for job scheduling

#### Client
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- FullCalendar.js
- Axios for API calls

### Security Considerations
1. WhatsApp session management
2. API authentication
3. Rate limiting
4. Message validation

### Scalability Considerations
1. Message queue management
2. Database optimization
3. Server resource management
4. Client-side caching

## Development Approach

### MVP Development Steps
1. Set up basic server with WhatsApp connectivity
2. Implement basic client interface
3. Develop core scheduling functionality
4. Add message preview/test features
5. Implement basic error handling
6. Deploy minimal viable product

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for core functions
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. UI component testing
4. End-to-end message flow testing
5. WhatsApp interaction testing

### Deployment Strategy
1. Server deployment on basic VPS
2. Client hosting on static hosting service
3. Database setup and migration
4. Monitoring setup

## Next Steps
1. Choose specific WhatsApp library
2. Set up development environment
3. Create basic server structure
4. Implement WhatsApp authentication
5. Develop basic client interface

I'll help organize and analyze your app idea for a WhatsApp message scheduler. Let me break this down systematically and then propose an MVP approach.



I've organized your requirements into a comprehensive technical specification. Let me highlight a few key decisions and recommendations:

1. For the MVP, I suggest using Python for the server component (due to mature WhatsApp libraries) and React + Node.js for the client. This gives you:
   - Reliable WhatsApp interaction
   - Easy scheduling capabilities
   - Modern, responsive UI
   - Scalable architecture

2. The client-server split makes sense because:
   - Server needs to maintain persistent WhatsApp connection
   - Allows multiple clients to connect
   - Centralizes message scheduling
   - Reduces client resource usage

3. For the MVP, I recommend focusing on:
   - Text-only messages
   - Basic calendar scheduling
   - Group selection
   - Message preview/testing
   - Basic delete functionality

Connecting Account
WhatsApp provides a multi-device API that allows Baileys to be authenticated as a second WhatsApp client by scanning a QR code or Pairing Code with WhatsApp on your phone.

Note

Here is a simple example of event handling

Tip

You can see all supported socket configs here (Recommended)

Starting socket with QR-CODE
Tip

You can customize browser name if you connect with QR-CODE, with Browser constant, we have some browsers config, see here

import makeWASocket from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    browser: Browsers.ubuntu('My App'),
    printQRInTerminal: true
})
If the connection is successful, you will see a QR code printed on your terminal screen, scan it with WhatsApp on your phone and you'll be logged in!

Starting socket with Pairing Code
Important

Pairing Code isn't Mobile API, it's a method to connect Whatsapp Web without QR-CODE, you can connect only with one device, see here

The phone number can't have + or () or -, only numbers, you must provide country code

import makeWASocket from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'

const sock = makeWASocket({
    // can provide additional config here
    printQRInTerminal: false //need to be false
})

if (!sock.authState.creds.registered) {
    const number = 'XXXXXXXXXXX'
    const code = await sock.requestPairingCode(number)
    console.log(code)
}
Receive Full History
Set syncFullHistory as true
Baileys, by default, use chrome browser config
If you'd like to emulate a desktop connection (and receive more message history), this browser setting to your Socket config:
const sock = makeWASocket({
    ...otherOpts,
    // can use Windows, Ubuntu here too
    browser: Browsers.macOS('Desktop'),
    syncFullHistory: true
})
Important Notes About Socket Config
Caching Group Metadata (Recommended)
If you use baileys for groups, we recommend you to set cachedGroupMetadata in socket config, you need to implement a cache like this:

const groupCache = new NodeCache({stdTTL: 5 * 60, useClones: false})

const sock = makeWASocket({
    cachedGroupMetadata: async (jid) => groupCache.get(jid)
})

sock.ev.on('groups.update', async ([event]) => {
    const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
    groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
})

sock.ev.on('group-participants.update', async (event) => {
    const metadata = await sock.groupMetadata(event.id)
    groupCache.set(event.id, metadata)
})
Improve Retry System & Decrypt Poll Votes
If you want to improve sending message, retrying when error occurs and decrypt poll votes, you need to have a store and set getMessage config in socket like this:
const sock = makeWASocket({
    getMessage: async (key) => await getMessageFromStore(key)
})
Receive Notifications in Whatsapp App
If you want to receive notifications in whatsapp app, set markOnlineOnConnect to false
const sock = makeWASocket({
    markOnlineOnConnect: false
})
Saving & Restoring Sessions
You obviously don't want to keep scanning the QR code every time you want to connect.

So, you can load the credentials to log back in:

import makeWASocket, { useMultiFileAuthState } from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'

const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState('auth_info_baileys')

// will use the given state to connect
// so if valid credentials are available -- it'll connect without QR
const sock = makeWASocket({ auth: state })

// this will be called as soon as the credentials are updated
sock.ev.on('creds.update', saveCreds)
Important

useMultiFileAuthState is a utility function to help save the auth state in a single folder, this function serves as a good guide to help write auth & key states for SQL/no-SQL databases, which I would recommend in any production grade system.

Note

When a message is received/sent, due to signal sessions needing updating, the auth keys (authState.keys) will update. Whenever that happens, you must save the updated keys (authState.keys.set() is called). Not doing so will prevent your messages from reaching the recipient & cause other unexpected consequences. The useMultiFileAuthState function automatically takes care of that, but for any other serious implementation -- you will need to be very careful with the key state management.

Handling Events
Baileys uses the EventEmitter syntax for events. They're all nicely typed up, so you shouldn't have any issues with an Intellisense editor like VS Code.
Important

The events are these, it's important you see all events

You can listen to these events like this:

const sock = makeWASocket()
sock.ev.on('messages.upsert', ({ messages }) => {
    console.log('got messages', messages)
})
Example to Start
Note

This example includes basic auth storage too

import makeWASocket, { DisconnectReason, useMultiFileAuthState } from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'
import { Boom } from '@hapi/boom'

async function connectToWhatsApp () {
    const { state, saveCreds } = await useMultiFileAuthState('auth_info_baileys')
    const sock = makeWASocket({
        // can provide additional config here
        auth: state,
        printQRInTerminal: true
    })
    sock.ev.on('connection.update', (update) => {
        const { connection, lastDisconnect } = update
        if(connection === 'close') {
            const shouldReconnect = (lastDisconnect.error as Boom)?.output?.statusCode !== DisconnectReason.loggedOut
            console.log('connection closed due to ', lastDisconnect.error, ', reconnecting ', shouldReconnect)
            // reconnect if not logged out
            if(shouldReconnect) {
                connectToWhatsApp()
            }
        } else if(connection === 'open') {
            console.log('opened connection')
        }
    })
    sock.ev.on('messages.upsert', event => {
        for (const m of event.messages) {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(m, undefined, 2))

            console.log('replying to', m.key.remoteJid)
            await sock.sendMessage(m.key.remoteJid!, { text: 'Hello Word' })
        }
    })

    // to storage creds (session info) when it updates
    sock.ev.on('creds.update', saveCreds)
}
// run in main file
connectToWhatsApp()
Important

In messages.upsert it's recommended to use a loop like for (const message of event.messages) to handle all messages in array

Decrypt Poll Votes
By default poll votes are encrypted and handled in messages.update
That's a simple example
sock.ev.on('messages.update', event => {
    for(const { key, update } of event) {
        if(update.pollUpdates) {
            const pollCreation = await getMessage(key)
            if(pollCreation) {
                console.log(
                    'got poll update, aggregation: ',
                    getAggregateVotesInPollMessage({
                        message: pollCreation,
                        pollUpdates: update.pollUpdates,
                    })
                )
            }
        }
    }
})
getMessage is a store implementation (in your end)
Summary of Events on First Connection
When you connect first time, connection.update will be fired requesting you to restart sock
Then, history messages will be received in messaging.history-set
Implementing a Data Store
Baileys does not come with a defacto storage for chats, contacts, or messages. However, a simple in-memory implementation has been provided. The store listens for chat updates, new messages, message updates, etc., to always have an up-to-date version of the data.
Important

I highly recommend building your own data store, as storing someone's entire chat history in memory is a terrible waste of RAM.

It can be used as follows:

import makeWASocket, { makeInMemoryStore } from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'
// the store maintains the data of the WA connection in memory
// can be written out to a file & read from it
const store = makeInMemoryStore({ })
// can be read from a file
store.readFromFile('./baileys_store.json')
// saves the state to a file every 10s
setInterval(() => {
    store.writeToFile('./baileys_store.json')
}, 10_000)

const sock = makeWASocket({ })
// will listen from this socket
// the store can listen from a new socket once the current socket outlives its lifetime
store.bind(sock.ev)

sock.ev.on('chats.upsert', () => {
    // can use 'store.chats' however you want, even after the socket dies out
    // 'chats' => a KeyedDB instance
    console.log('got chats', store.chats.all())
})

sock.ev.on('contacts.upsert', () => {
    console.log('got contacts', Object.values(store.contacts))
})
The store also provides some simple functions such as loadMessages that utilize the store to speed up data retrieval.

Whatsapp IDs Explain
id is the WhatsApp ID, called jid too, of the person or group you're sending the message to.
It must be in the format [country code][phone number]@s.whatsapp.net
Example for people: +19999999999@s.whatsapp.net.
For groups, it must be in the format 123456789-123345@g.us.
For broadcast lists, it's [timestamp of creation]@broadcast.
For stories, the ID is status@broadcast.
Utility Functions
getContentType, returns the content type for any message
getDevice, returns the device from message
makeCacheableSignalKeyStore, make auth store more fast
downloadContentFromMessage, download content from any message
Sending Messages
Send all types of messages with a single function

Here you can see all message contents supported, like text message
Here you can see all options supported, like quote message
const jid: string
const content: AnyMessageContent
const options: MiscMessageGenerationOptions

sock.sendMessage(jid, content, options)
Non-Media Messages
Text Message
await sock.sendMessage(jid, { text: 'hello word' })
Quote Message (works with all types)
await sock.sendMessage(jid, { text: 'hello word' }, { quoted: message })
Mention User (works with most types)
@number is to mention in text, it's optional
await sock.sendMessage(
    jid,

    jid, 
    {
        location: {
            degreesLatitude: 24.121231,

            + 'ORG:Ashoka Uni;\n' // the organization of the contact
            + 'TEL;type=CELL;type=VOICE;waid=911234567890:+91 12345 67890\n' // WhatsApp ID + phone number
            + 'END:VCARD'

await sock.sendMessage(
    id,
    { 
        contacts: { 
            displayName: 'Jeff', 
            contacts: [{ vcard }] 
        }
    }
)
Reaction Message
You need to pass the key of message, you can retrieve from store or use a key object
await sock.sendMessage(
    jid,
    {
        react: {
            text: '💖', // use an empty string to remove the reaction
            key: message.key
        }
    }
)
Pin Message
You need to pass the key of message, you can retrieve from store or use a key object

Time can be:

Time	Seconds
24h	86.400
7d	604.800
30d	2.592.000
await sock.sendMessage(
    jid,
    {
        pin: {
            type: 1, // 0 to remove
            time: 86400
            key: message.key
        }
    }
)
Poll Message
await sock.sendMessage(
    jid,
    {
        poll: {
            name: 'My Poll',
            values: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', ...],
            selectableCount: 1,
            toAnnouncementGroup: false // or true
        }
    }
)
Sending Messages with Link Previews
By default, wa does not have link generation when sent from the web
Baileys has a function to generate the content for these link previews
To enable this function's usage, add link-preview-js as a dependency to your project with yarn add link-preview-js
Send a link:
await sock.sendMessage(
    jid,
    {
        text: 'Hi, this was sent using https://github.com/whiskeysockets/baileys'
    }
)
Media Messages
Sending media (video, stickers, images) is easier & more efficient than ever.

Note

In media messages, you can pass { stream: Stream } or { url: Url } or Buffer directly, you can see more here

When specifying a media url, Baileys never loads the entire buffer into memory; it even encrypts the media as a readable stream.
Tip

It's recommended to use Stream or Url to save memory

Gif Message
Whatsapp doesn't support .gif files, that's why we send gifs as common .mp4 video with gifPlayback flag
await sock.sendMessage(
    jid, 
    { 
        video: fs.readFileSync('Media/ma_gif.mp4'),
        caption: 'hello word',
        gifPlayback: true
    }
)
Video Message
await sock.sendMessage(
    id, 
    { 
        video: {
            url: './Media/ma_gif.mp4'
        },
        caption: 'hello word',
	    ptv: false // if set to true, will send as a `video note`
    }
)
Audio Message
To audio message work in all devices you need to convert with some tool like ffmpeg with this flags:
    codec: libopus //ogg file
    ac: 1 //one channel
    avoid_negative_ts
    make_zero
Example:
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -avoid_negative_ts make_zero -ac 1 output.ogg
await sock.sendMessage(
    jid, 
    {
        audio: {
            url: './Media/audio.mp3'
        },
        mimetype: 'audio/mp4'
    }
)
Image Message
await sock.sendMessage(
    id, 
    { 
        image: {
            url: './Media/ma_img.png'
        },
        caption: 'hello word'
    }
)
View Once Message
You can send all messages above as viewOnce, you only need to pass viewOnce: true in content object
await sock.sendMessage(
    id, 
    { 
        image: {
            url: './Media/ma_img.png'
        },
        viewOnce: true, //works with video, audio too
        caption: 'hello word'
    }
)
Modify Messages
Deleting Messages (for everyone)
const msg = await sock.sendMessage(jid, { text: 'hello word' })
await sock.sendMessage(jid, { delete: msg.key })
Note: deleting for oneself is supported via chatModify, see in this section

Editing Messages
You can pass all editable contents here
await sock.sendMessage(jid, {
      text: 'updated text goes here',
      edit: response.key,
    });
Manipulating Media Messages
Thumbnail in Media Messages
For media messages, the thumbnail can be generated automatically for images & stickers provided you add jimp or sharp as a dependency in your project using yarn add jimp or yarn add sharp.
Thumbnails for videos can also be generated automatically, though, you need to have ffmpeg installed on your system.
Downloading Media Messages
If you want to save the media you received

import { createWriteStream } from 'fs'
import { downloadMediaMessage, getContentType } from '@whiskeysockets/baileys'

sock.ev.on('messages.upsert', async ({ [m] }) => {
    if (!m.message) return // if there is no text or media message
    const messageType = getContentType(m) // get what type of message it is (text, image, video...)

    // if the message is an image
    if (messageType === 'imageMessage') {
        // download the message
        const stream = await downloadMediaMessage(
            m,
            'stream', // can be 'buffer' too
            { },
            { 
                logger,
                // pass this so that baileys can request a reupload of media
                // that has been deleted
                reuploadRequest: sock.updateMediaMessage
            }
        )
        // save to file
        const writeStream = createWriteStream('./my-download.jpeg')
        stream.pipe(writeStream)
    }
}
Re-upload Media Message to Whatsapp
WhatsApp automatically removes old media from their servers. For the device to access said media -- a re-upload is required by another device that has it. This can be accomplished using:
await sock.updateMediaMessage(msg)
Reject Call
You can obtain callId and callFrom from call event
await sock.rejectCall(callId, callFrom)
Send States in Chat
Reading Messages
A set of message keys must be explicitly marked read now.
You cannot mark an entire 'chat' read as it were with Baileys Web. This means you have to keep track of unread messages.
const key: WAMessageKey
// can pass multiple keys to read multiple messages as well
await sock.readMessages([key])
The message ID is the unique identifier of the message that you are marking as read. On a WAMessage, the messageID can be accessed using messageID = message.key.id.

Update Presence
presence can be one of these
The presence expires after about 10 seconds.
This lets the person/group with jid know whether you're online, offline, typing etc.
await sock.sendPresenceUpdate('available', jid) 
Note

If a desktop client is active, WA doesn't send push notifications to the device. If you would like to receive said notifications -- mark your Baileys client offline using sock.sendPresenceUpdate('unavailable')

Modifying Chats
WA uses an encrypted form of communication to send chat/app updates. This has been implemented mostly and you can send the following updates:

Important

If you mess up one of your updates, WA can log you out of all your devices and you'll have to log in again.

Broadcast Lists & Stories
Send Broadcast & Stories
Messages can be sent to broadcasts & stories. You need to add the following message options in sendMessage, like this:
await sock.sendMessage(
    jid,
    {
        image: {
            url: url
        },
        caption: caption
    },
    {
        backgroundColor: backgroundColor,
        font: font,
        statusJidList: statusJidList,
        broadcast: true
    }
)
Message body can be a extendedTextMessage or imageMessage or videoMessage or voiceMessage, see here

You can add backgroundColor and other options in the message options, see here

broadcast: true enables broadcast mode

statusJidList: a list of people that you can get which you need to provide, which are the people who will get this status message.

You can send messages to broadcast lists the same way you send messages to groups & individual chats.

Right now, WA Web does not support creating broadcast lists, but you can still delete them.

Broadcast IDs are in the format 12345678@broadcast

Query a Broadcast List's Recipients & Name
const bList = await sock.getBroadcastListInfo('1234@broadcast')
console.log (`list name: ${bList.name}, recps: ${bList.recipients}`)
Writing Custom Functionality
Baileys is written with custom functionality in mind. Instead of forking the project & re-writing the internals, you can simply write your own extensions.

Enabling Debug Level in Baileys Logs
First, enable the logging of unhandled messages from WhatsApp by setting:

const sock = makeWASocket({
    logger: P({ level: 'debug' }),
})
This will enable you to see all sorts of messages WhatsApp sends in the console.

How Whatsapp Communicate With Us
Tip

If you want to learn whatsapp protocol, we recommend to study about Libsignal Protocol and Noise Protocol

Example: Functionality to track the battery percentage of your phone. You enable logging and you'll see a message about your battery pop up in the console:
{
    "level": 10,
    "fromMe": false,
    "frame": {
        "tag": "ib",
        "attrs": {
            "from": "@s.whatsapp.net"
        },
        "content": [
            {
                "tag": "edge_routing",
                "attrs": {},
                "content": [
                    {
                        "tag": "routing_info",
                        "attrs": {},
                        "content": {
                            "type": "Buffer",
                            "data": [8,2,8,5]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "msg":"communication"
}
The 'frame' is what the message received is, it has three components:

tag -- what this frame is about (eg. message will have 'message')
attrs -- a string key-value pair with some metadata (contains ID of the message usually)
content -- the actual data (eg. a message node will have the actual message content in it)
read more about this format here
Register a Callback for Websocket Events
Tip

Recommended to see onMessageReceived function in socket.ts file to understand how websockets events are fired

// for any message with tag 'edge_routing'
sock.ws.on('CB:edge_routing', (node: BinaryNode) => { })

// for any message with tag 'edge_routing' and id attribute = abcd
sock.ws.on('CB:edge_routing,id:abcd', (node: BinaryNode) => { })

// for any message with tag 'edge_routing', id attribute = abcd & first content node routing_info
sock.ws.on('CB:edge_routing,id:abcd,routing_info', (node: BinaryNode) => { })

Questions to consider:
what libraries are best, is this a good plan can you adjust it and make it clean and focused for developers walking stage by stage. can you ensure there is tightness and focus and clarity every step of the way? make it so that a developer can easily implement, test an idea, and iterate on their computer before they have to deploy it on a server. understand that the build space for the developer will be a mac and ultimate deployment is a server with linux and a client browser whether its desktop or mobile. 

---

_**Assistant**_

**Below is a streamlined summary of your voice note and requirements, followed by a clean, step-by-step prompt you could provide to an LLM or a developer.**

---

## 1. Cleaned-Up Requirements

1. **Goal**  
   - Build a WhatsApp scheduling application that allows scheduling text (MVP) and eventually media (images, videos, audio, polls) to specific WhatsApp groups or individual contacts.

2. **Architecture Overview**  
   - **Server Component** (persistent WhatsApp connection):
     - Maintains the WhatsApp session (using either Python or Node.js, whichever library is more robust/stable for your environment).
     - Receives scheduled messages from the client and sends them at the correct time.
     - Stores and manages data (scheduling info, group lists, etc.).
   - **Client Component** (web application or browser-based UI):
     - Lets you create, schedule, delete, preview, and manage messages in a calendar view.
     - Allows for selecting which groups/contacts to send the message to.
     - Sends scheduling instructions and message data to the server via APIs.

3. **Core MVP Features**  
   - **Text-Only Scheduling**  
     - Create text messages with scheduled send times.  
     - View these scheduled messages on a visual calendar (drag-and-drop or standard date/time picker).
   - **Send to Groups/Individuals**  
     - Pick multiple WhatsApp groups or specific contacts for each scheduled message.
   - **Delete Messages**  
     - Ability to trigger the “delete for everyone” if still within WhatsApp’s allowed timeframe.
   - **Preview & Test**  
     - Option to send a test message to yourself before sending to the group.
   - **Calendar/List View**  
     - See upcoming scheduled posts in multiple views: daily/weekly/monthly or a simple list.
   - **Persistent Server**  
     - The WhatsApp session must remain active so scheduling works 24/7.

4. **Expanded Future Features** (beyond MVP)  
   - Support for images, videos, audio, polls.  
   - Message templates / library of past content.  
   - Categories/tags for different post types.  
   - Automated scheduling suggestions for event promotions.  
   - Advanced analytics and campaign management.

5. **Technology Recommendations**  
   - **Server**  
     - Python + [pywhatkit] or [selenium-web-whatsapp], OR  
     - Node.js + [Baileys] for multi-device WhatsApp API.  
     - A scheduler like `APScheduler` (Python) or `node-cron` (Node) to handle timed sends.  
   - **Client**  
     - A lightweight web app using React (or basic HTML/CSS/JS if you want simplicity).  
     - A UI toolkit (Tailwind CSS, or shadcn/ui) plus [FullCalendar.js] for the scheduling calendar.  
   - **Data Storage**  
     - An SQL or NoSQL DB. For quick prototyping, SQLite can suffice.  
     - Store scheduled messages, group/contacts data, and message history.

6. **Local Development & Deployment**  
   - **Local Dev**: Mac or Windows environment with Node.js or Python installed.  
   - **Deployment**: Likely a Linux VPS or container (e.g., Docker) for the server piece to keep the WhatsApp session active. The client can be served from the same machine or a separate hosting service.

## 2. Step-by-Step Prompt for an LLM or Developer

Below is a concise prompt you could provide to an AI or hand to a developer to structure the app’s MVP and plan iterative phases.

> **WhatsApp Scheduler MVP Prompt**  
>  
> 1. **Project Description**:  
>    - I need a WhatsApp scheduling application that sends text messages to multiple groups or individual contacts at specific times. In future versions, it will also handle media (images, videos, audio, polls).  
>  
> 2. **Architecture Requirements**:  
>    - Must include a “Server Component” that retains an active WhatsApp session and handles message sending/deleting.  
>    - Must include a “Client Component” (web UI) that allows scheduling, editing, and previewing messages on a calendar.  
>    - Data is persisted in a database (SQLite for MVP is acceptable).  
>  
> 3. **MVP Feature Requirements**:  
>    - Text-only scheduling.  
>    - Send to multiple groups/contacts.  
>    - Visual calendar UI for scheduling.  
>    - Delete scheduled messages if needed (with “delete for everyone” option, respecting WhatsApp’s time limit).  
>    - Send a test message to the user’s own WhatsApp.  
>    - Ability to handle persistent WhatsApp session (24/7).  
>  
> 4. **Libraries & Technologies**:  
>    - Evaluate:  
>      - **Server**:  
>        - Python + pywhatkit / selenium.  
>        - Node.js + Baileys.  
>      - **Client**:  
>        - React + Tailwind CSS + FullCalendar.js.  
>        - Alternatively, minimal HTML/JS + existing drag/drop calendar library.  
>      - **Scheduling**: APScheduler (Python) or node-cron (Node).  
>      - **Database**: SQLite for prototyping.  
>  
> 5. **Implementation Plan**:  
>    **Stage 1: Server Setup**  
>      - Pick WhatsApp library (Python or Node).  
>      - Implement basic WhatsApp authentication & session.  
>      - Create minimal APIs (POST /api/messages, GET /api/messages, DELETE /api/messages/:id).  
>      - Integrate a basic scheduling job for sending messages at the correct time.  
>    
>    **Stage 2: Client Setup**  
>      - Build a simple web interface (React or plain HTML/CSS/JS).  
>      - Integrate a calendar library (FullCalendar.js).  
>      - Implement form for scheduling new textual messages (time, recipients, content).  
>      - Call server APIs to create/list/delete scheduled messages.  
>      - Add a “send test to self” button.  
>    
>    **Stage 3: Polishing**  
>      - Improve error handling & notifications.  
>      - Refine calendar UI (drag-and-drop or better date/time pickers).  
>      - Basic responsive design for mobile use.  
>    
>    **Stage 4: Next Phases**  
>      - Media support (images, video, audio).  
>      - Template/library of past messages.  
>      - Categories & tags for more advanced organization.  
>      - Automated scheduling suggestions for event-based marketing.  
>      - Analytics & reporting (message success logs, read confirmations, etc.).  
>  
> 6. **Environment & Testing**:  
>    - **Local**:  
>      - Develop on Mac/Windows with Node.js or Python.  
>      - Use a local SQLite DB for quick iteration.  
>      - For the WhatsApp session, keep the console open to scan a QR code or store credentials for persistent login.  
>    - **Server Deployment**:  
>      - Host on a Linux VPS or container.  
>      - Keep the process running using PM2 (Node) or a systemd service (Python).  
>      - Expose client from the same server or a separate hosting service.  
>  
> 7. **Success Criteria**:  
>    - Ability to schedule text messages (single or multiple recipients) via a user-friendly calendar UI.  
>    - Reliable, persistent WhatsApp session that sends out messages on time.  
>    - Delete functionality within WhatsApp’s “delete for everyone” timeframe.  
>    - Clear logs and error-handling to track message sends.  
>  
> 8. **Questions & Clarifications**:  
>    - Which WhatsApp library or approach (Python vs. Node) best suits our hosting environment?  
>    - How robust does the scheduling need to be (e.g., recurring tasks, advanced triggers)?  
>    - How will user authentication and roles be handled (single admin user vs. multi-tenant)?  
>    - Confirm that once the MVP is stable, we aim to expand into media messages, categories, analytics, etc.

### How to Use this Prompt
You can copy/paste this prompt into your conversation with an LLM or hand it off to a developer. It concisely captures the MVP scope and planned architecture. From there, you can iterate on details like choice of WhatsApp library, hosting provider, and user authentication specifics.

## 3. Notes on Best Libraries
- **Python**  
  - [pywhatkit]: Quick scripts, good for simple text-based tasks, but less robust on multi-device scenarios.  
  - Selenium-based solutions: May be heavier to maintain (headless browser), but can work if multi-device libraries are not reliable.  
- **Node.js**  
  - [Baileys]: Actively maintained, specifically built for multi-device WhatsApp. Has robust community support and well-documented capabilities.

Given your Mac development environment and eventual Linux server deployment, you can use either ecosystem comfortably. Choose whichever stack aligns with your team’s skills and preferences.

**That’s the concise layout**—it should be clear, testable locally, and easily deployed once stable. Feel free to refine each stage as you progress!
